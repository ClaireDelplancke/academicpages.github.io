# About

Since mid-2022 I am a research engineer at EDF-Lab Paris Saclay, where I work on energy management and resource optimization. Before that, I completed my PhD in Applied Mathematics in 2017, followed by two Research Associate positions with a focus on stochastic algorithm for inverse problems, the first one at the University of Chile and the second one at the University of Bath.
