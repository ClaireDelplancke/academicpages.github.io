# Introduction

Since January 2020, I am a Research Associate at the Department of Mathematical Sciences of the University of Bath, where I work with [Matthias Ehrhardt](https://mehrhardt.github.io/index.html) on the project [PET++](https://petpp.github.io). My  research interests are centered on the stochastic algorithms used in Machine Learning and Optimization, applied to medical and seismic tomography.

# News

* The first of the two [**PET++/CCPi/SyneRBI hackathons**](https://petpp.github.io/#Hackathons) I co-organise on *stochastic algorithms for tomographic reconstruction* took place on November - stay tuned for the announcement of the second one in early 2022.

* Presented a talk at the **IEEE Medical Imaging Conference 2021** on *Accelerated Convergent
Motion Compensated Image Reconstruction* (joint work with Matthias J. Ehrhadt and Kris Thielemans).
